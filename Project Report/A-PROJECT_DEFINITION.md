## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
#### Project Summary

Gringotts National Bank (GNB) associates with loans and finances. They deal with various types of loans such as car loans, business loans, home loans and so on. Going through the loan eligibility process can be tedious and very time consuming. Hence, an automated process will ease this process.

This is a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a loan will or will not be approved. A model is developed by which the model is capable of using the features to predict the target varibale, which is if a loan is approved or a loan is declined.
