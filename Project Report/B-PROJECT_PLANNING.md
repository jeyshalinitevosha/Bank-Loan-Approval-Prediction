# PROJECT OVERVIEW 
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle 
A Gantt Chart is used to represent the Project Management Life Cycle of this project. For our project, we used Microsoft Project to document our Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) as well as our Gantt Chart. This way, we can plan our project in a more organised way. Besides that, it also helps us keep track on our milestones. 

The image below is our WBS + Gantt Chart:

### Risk Identification Chart 

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|------|-------|-----|
|Quality|The system predicts the loan approval status wrongly|We will notice that the input criteria does not match the output results. For example, if applicant has low income and does not meet standard credit history, but their loan is predicted to be approved, then we can identify that something is wrong. <br> <br> This risk can be identified during the testing phase.|Give remarks to Quality Manager to always make sure that predictions make sense.|
|Cost|The project's cost exceeds the set budget.|We can identify this when there is a need for addtional fundings.<br><br>This risk will be faced especially during project implementation or deployment. |Always make sure that fundings and expenditures are deeply analysed and updated. 
|Time| The project is not able to be completed on time.     |The are unexpected problems arising, especially risks that we did not see coming. <br><br> The risks will be encountered during a particular phase that the project is undergoing.| Have a meeting and find for ways to overcome this problem through discussion with other team members. Brainstorm new ideas and plans.|

| Project Manager | Project managers play the lead role in planning, executing, monitoring, controlling and closing projects. They are accountable for the entire project scope, project team, resources, and the success or failure of the project. A project manager, with the help of their team, is charged with multiple responsibilities that span the five project phases of a project life cycle (initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and closing). The project management phases intersect with 10 knowledge areas. The knowledge areas include integration, scope, time, cost, quality, human resources, communication, risk procurement and stakeholder management.|
| Stakeholder Coordinator | Ensure stakeholder records are kept up-to-date and reflect latest contact and engagement activities. Research, populate and manage database of event and speaking opportunities and prepare recommendations for project team members accordingly. |
