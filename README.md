# Bank-Loan-Approval-Prediction
We are students from Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM) pursuing our Bachelor's Degree in Artificial Intelligence (with Honours). Currently, we are in our third year. This project is meant for the subject BITI 3533, Artificial Intelligence Project Management. Our lecturer's name is Professor Ts. Dr. Goh Oh Sing. Our project is carried out in a group. 

##### Group members:  
1. Jeyshalini Tevosha (Project Manager)     B031810246  
2. Previna Munuganan                        B031810286

As for our project, we decided to develop a Bank Loan Approval Prediction System. Loan approval is very prominent in any banking organization. In recent years, many studies have been done on loan approval prediction systems. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are very useful in predicting outcomes for big data. Thus, in this project, ML will be used to implement the loan approval system.

## Business Problem 
Gringotts National Bank (GNB) associates with loans and finances. They deal with various types of loans such as car loans, business loans, home loans and so on. Going through the loan eligibility process can be tedious and very time consuming. Hence, an automated process will easen this process. 

This is a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a loan will or will not be approved. A model needs to be developed by which the model is capable of using the features to predict the target varibale, which is if a loan is approved or a loan is declined. 

## Objectives
1. To develop a model that predicts the approval status of a loan  
2. To save time consumption  
3. To improve speed of customer service
