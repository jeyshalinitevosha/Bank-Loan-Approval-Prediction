As for our project, we decided to develop a Bank Loan Approval Prediction System. Loan approval is very prominent in any banking organization. In recent years, many studies have been done on loan approval prediction systems. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are very useful in predicting outcomes for big data. Thus, in this project, ML will be used to implement the loan approval system.
